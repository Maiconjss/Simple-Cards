## Project's goal

Study a little more about UX / UI, with these simple cards with icons and a supposed link to another area of ​​the application through the arrow icon located just below the user's view area.

## Technologies used and experience during development

I noticed that during my searches to arrive at this simple example, many professionals pay attention to the user's goal and NOT visual pollution, with this the application becomes more attractive and less exhausting for the user.

## Conclusion and personal gain

It is simply amazing how much we can use minimalism to make a user even more comfortable with an interface, in view of what I learned from this I will go even deeper into the subject and not only transform layouts into code, but understand the reason for each element to be there, it was very rewarding.
